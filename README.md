# KarbonKitty's Awesome RPG Generators

A set of web-based procedural generators geared towards modern, cyberpunk and sci-fi games. If you are looking for a quick NPC, handful of stuff found in someone's pocket, just go to [this webpage](https://karbonkitty.github.io/rpg-generator-ts) and roll away!

Current plan is to move the app to Vue components, and prepare it for offline use.

Entire generators are available under MIT license.
